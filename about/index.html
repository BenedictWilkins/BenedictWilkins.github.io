<p>Learning is my main passion in life, learning about the world, my-self (not that they are necessarily distinct), and the rich variety of human endeavour. My focus is usually academic, and on artificial intelligence research.</p>
<p>AI, and more so, the nature of intelligence and its possibilities, has been on my mind for a (relatively) long time.
A great interview question I was once asked was: <em>&ldquo;if you had unlimited resources to work on a project in the AI space, what would you work on?&quot;</em>
Avoiding a discussion of the meaning of <em>unlimited resources</em>, paraphrased, and put more eloquently than what was actually said, I answered: &ldquo;to create an intelligence that could see beyond my own in the hope that it might teach me what I am ignorant about.&rdquo; I think this answer is typical given my background, but speaks volumes about our struggle and desire for understanding, after all, why else does a person devote their life to study other than to raise the veil.</p>
