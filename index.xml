      <description>Recently I have been looking into Siamese networks in my research, for my own understanding I like to implement new models that I come across - if you can code it you must understand it! Lets begin.

As always, and with little to no understanding of the library I jumped straight in and tried to develop a super complicated GUI for a project I have been working on called vacuumworld.</description>
